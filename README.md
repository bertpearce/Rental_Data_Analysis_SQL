# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

The Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project is a CareerFoundry Data Analytics certification project designed to showcase the SQL query-based analysis skills I've learned. The files in this repository are highlights from the assignments I've completed that build toward the final project involving moderately complex SQL queries I wrote to answer business questions that are communicated through a professional presentation.
